ISS Tracker and Email Notifier
  This Python program tracks the International Space Station (ISS) and sends an email notification if the ISS is passing close to a specified location and it is currently dark at that location.

Features
  ISS Position Tracking: Uses the ISS API to get the current latitude and longitude of the ISS.
  Proximity Detection: Checks if the ISS is within ±5 degrees of the user's specified location (latitude and longitude).
  Day/Night Check: Determines whether it is currently dark at the user's location using the Sunrise-Sunset API.
  Email Notification: If the ISS is nearby and it's dark, the program sends an email to notify the user to "look up" and spot the ISS.
  Continuous Monitoring: The program runs every 60 seconds and continuously checks the conditions.

How It Works
  Check ISS Position: The program requests the current position of the ISS from the Open Notify ISS API.
  Determine Proximity: It compares the ISS's position with the user’s location (latitude and longitude) to check if the ISS is within a 5-degree range.
  Day/Night Check: The program checks if it is currently dark at the user’s location by retrieving the sunrise and sunset times from the Sunrise-Sunset API.
  Send Notification: If both conditions (proximity and darkness) are met, the program sends an email to the user to notify them that the ISS is overhead.
  Loop: The program runs continuously, checking the conditions every 60 seconds.
  Installation and Setup

Prerequisites
  Python 3.x installed on your machine
  Internet connection to access the ISS and Sunrise-Sunset APIs
  A Gmail account (or other SMTP email service) to send notifications
  Libraries Required
    requests: To make API calls to the ISS position and Sunrise-Sunset APIs
    smtplib: For sending email notifications
    datetime: To handle time-related tasks
    time: To manage time delays between checks

Steps to Set Up
  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
  Replace your_email@gmail.com with your actual email address.
  Replace your_password with your email account password (or app password if using Gmail).
  Replace recipient_email@gmail.com with the recipient email where you want to receive notifications.
  Modify the latitude and longitude in the script (MY_LAT and MY_LONG) to your current location.

API References
  ISS Location API: Open Notify ISS API
  Sunrise and Sunset Times API: Sunrise-Sunset API

Troubleshooting
  Email Issues: Make sure you have enabled "Less secure app access" on your Gmail account or use an app-specific password.
  ISS Position Not Updating: The ISS API may occasionally fail due to network issues. If the program encounters an error, try restarting it.
