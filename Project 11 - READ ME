**Blackjack Game**
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Blackjack card game. You can play against the computer, which acts as the dealer. 
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value that is closer to 21 without exceeding it.

**Game Rules**
The deck is unlimited in size and there are no jokers.
Cards are represented by numbers:
  Numbers 2-10 have their face values.
  Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points.
  Aces can be worth either 11 or 1, depending on which is more favorable for the hand.
  The game is played against a dealer (the computer), and cards are drawn with equal probability.
  Cards are not removed from the deck after being drawn, so they can appear multiple times.

**Features**
The player is dealt two cards at the start of the game.
The dealer is also dealt two cards, but only one card is visible to the player.
The player can choose to either draw another card (hit) or stop (stand).
The dealer will continue drawing cards until its hand total is at least 17.
The player or dealer wins by having a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it. If a hand exceeds 21, it "busts" and loses.
A Blackjack is when the player or dealer has exactly 21 with the first two cards dealt. A Blackjack wins the game immediately.

**How to Play**
Starting the Game: The player is prompted to start a new game of Blackjack by typing 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no).

Player's Turn: The player is dealt two cards and can choose to either:
  Draw another card by typing 'y'.
  Stop drawing by typing 'n'.

Dealer's Turn: The dealer's cards are revealed, and the dealer will draw additional cards until their hand value reaches 17 or more.

Result: The winner is determined based on the hand totals:
  If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose immediately.
  If both the player and the dealer have the same hand value, the game is a draw.
  The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealerâ€™s hand.

**Special Conditions**
If the player or the dealer has a Blackjack (exactly 21 points with the first two cards), the game ends immediately, and the Blackjack holder wins.
Aces (represented by 11) are adjusted to be worth 1 if the hand total exceeds 21.

**How the Code Works**
Main Game Loop: The game runs in a loop where the player is continuously prompted to start a new game or exit.
Player Actions: The player can keep drawing cards until they choose to stop or go over 21 points.
Dealer Actions: The dealer automatically draws cards until their total reaches 17 or more.
Evaluation: At the end of the game, both hands are evaluated to determine the winner.

**Requirements**
This program runs in Python and uses the random module to simulate card draws.
