# Turtle Race Game

**How to Play**:
  1. Choose your favorite turtle color to bet on.
  2. Watch the turtles race as they move randomly towards the finish line.
  3. If your chosen turtle wins the race, you win! If not, you lose.

## Features

- **Colorful Turtles**: Six turtles, each with a unique color representing the colors of the rainbow.
- **Random Movement**: Each turtle moves a random distance on each step, adding excitement and unpredictability to the race.
- **Interactive Betting**: Input your bet to select which turtle you think will win the race.
- **Finish Line**: A prominent finish line is drawn to indicate where the race ends.

## How to Run

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python installed on your machine.
   - The `turtle` module, which is included with standard Python installations.

2. **Running the Game**:
   - Save the script to a file, e.g., `turtle_race.py`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python turtle_race.py
     ```

3. **Playing the Game**:
   - When prompted, enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on.
   - Watch the turtles race across the screen.
   - A message will be displayed indicating whether your turtle won or lost.

## Code Breakdown

- **Setup**:
  - Initializes the game screen and sets up the finish line.
  - Creates and positions six turtles with different colors.

- **Game Logic**:
  - Prompts the user to bet on a turtle.
  - Starts the race and moves turtles forward by random distances.
  - Determines the winner when a turtle crosses the finish line and displays the result.

## Important Functions

- `finish_line_draw()`: Draws the finish line where the turtles will race to.
- `screen.textinput()`: Prompts the user to enter their bet.
- `turtle.forward()`: Moves the turtle forward by a random distance in each step.

## Notes

- The race will continue until one turtle crosses the finish line.
- The result of the race is displayed both on the screen and in the terminal/command prompt.

## Troubleshooting

- **Turtles Not Moving**: Ensure that Python and the `turtle` module are correctly installed. The turtles should move with each race iteration.
- **No Display**: If the window doesn't appear, make sure your Python environment supports GUI operations.
