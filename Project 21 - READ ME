Pong Game
This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Pong Game using the turtle module. 
The game features two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard. 
Players control the paddles to hit the ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

How the Game Works

Objective: Use your paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from passing your side of the screen. Score points by getting the ball past the opponent’s paddle.
Gameplay:
  Paddles: Controlled by the players. One player uses the Up and Down arrow keys, while the other player uses the W and S keys.
  Ball: Moves across the screen and bounces off walls and paddles.
  Scoreboard: Keeps track of scores for both players.
  Features
  Two Paddles: Each player controls one paddle to hit the ball.
  Ball Movement: The ball moves and bounces off the paddles and walls.
  Scoring System: The scoreboard tracks and displays the score for both players.
  Collision Detection: Detects collisions between the ball and paddles or walls, adjusting the ball’s direction accordingly.
  Score Updates: Points are scored when the ball passes a paddle, and the scoreboard updates accordingly.

How to Play

Control the Paddles:
Right Paddle (Player 1):
Up Arrow Key: Move the paddle up.
Down Arrow Key: Move the paddle down.
Left Paddle (Player 2):
W Key: Move the paddle up.
S Key: Move the paddle down.

Objective:
Hit the ball with your paddle to keep it in play.
Score a point by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

Scoring:
Points are awarded when the ball passes a paddle.
The game continues until you close the game window.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x must be installed on your machine.
The turtle module (part of the standard Python library) is required.
Running the Game
Save all the game files (main.py, paddle.py, ball.py, and scoreboard.py) in the same directory.

The main script that initializes the game:

Sets up the game screen.
Creates paddles and ball objects.
Handles the main game loop, including ball movement, collision detection, and score updates.
paddle.py

Contains the Paddle class:
Initializes the paddle's shape, size, and position.
Provides methods to move the paddle up and down.
ball.py
Contains the Ball class:
Initializes the ball’s shape and movement.
Provides methods to move the ball, bounce off walls and paddles, and reset its position.
scoreboard.py
Contains the Scoreboard class:
Manages and displays the scores for both players.
Updates the scoreboard when a player scores a point.

Customization
Paddle and Ball Appearance: Modify the shapes and colors of the paddles and ball in their respective classes (paddle.py and ball.py).
Scoreboard Font: Change the font size and style in the Scoreboard class if desired.
